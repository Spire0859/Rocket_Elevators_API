Project Title : The Rocket Elevators Database
https://spireee.com/

	Project Description
*WHAT THE APPLICATION DOES:
The application uses
	- Ruby 2.7.6
	- Rails 5.2.8
	- pg gem (for the rake tasks)
	- faker gem (for the seeds file)
	
## IMPORTANT
our apis keys are obviously not here or are not the up to date ones in the project, please either specify your api keys int he .env folder
or directly in the api calls


If you have an admin account, you can just use your admin email address (from
the employee list) and enter the password : 123456 	// (Very safe!)

WHY THIS TECHNOLOGY?
MySQL is used as an operative database were most of the data get treated. But we also used a
Postgresql database that act as a Database Warehouse in the background. When the MySQL
database is filled with data, it is then sent to the Postgresql DWH in different tables and
you can ask 3 questions via rake tasks.

	Those rake task commands are:
	1. rake qs:q_one
	2. rake qs:q_two
	3. rake qs:q_three
	(You may find the code at the bottom of the newtask.rake file)

In case this does not function properly. Abort the ship, destroy the evidence and pray...
OR!
Try those queries via the SQL editor in DBeaver. These lines answers the the respective 
question numbers:

	1. select contact_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM creation_date)
           FROM fact_contact;
	
	2. select quote_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM creation_date)
	   FROM fact_quotes;
	
	3. SELECT company_name, nb_elevators
	   FROM public.dim_customers;
